# GE-Aviation
GE Aviation, an operating unit of GE (NYSE: GE), is a world-leading provider of jet and turboprop engines, as well as integrated systems for commercial, military, business and general aviation aircraft.

I used Apache Spark, that is a unified computing engine and a set of libraries for parallel data processing on computer clusters. As of this writing, Spark is the most actively developed open source engine for this task, making it a standard tool for any developer or data scientist interested in big data.

Spark supports multiple widely used programming languages (Python, Java, Scala, and R),
includes libraries for diverse tasks ranging from SQL to streaming and machine learning, and
runs anywhere from a laptop to a cluster of thousands of servers. This makes it an easy system to
start with and scale-up to big data processing or incredibly large scale.

Spark is designed to support a wide range of data analytics tasks,ranging from simple data loading and SQL queries to machine learning and streaming computation, over the same computing engine and with a consistent set of APIs. The main insight behind this goal is that real-world data analytics tasks—whether they are interactive analytics in a tool such as a Jupyter notebook, or traditional software development for production applications—tend to combine many different processing types and libraries.
